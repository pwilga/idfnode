# idfnode

**Template project for ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework)**  
Minimal, extensible ESP32 firmware boilerplate â€“ ready for real-world IoT projects.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Included Modules

This template project includes the following components:

### âœ… Wi-Fi Setup
Connects ESP32 to your Wi-Fi network using either `sdkconfig` or hardcoded credentials.  
You can configure Wi-Fi via `idf.py menuconfig` or by editing the code directly.

### âœ… OTA (Over-the-Air Updates)
Built-in HTTP OTA server on ESP32 â€“ accepts firmware uploads via HTTP POST.  
Firmware can be uploaded using the included `ota.py` Python client.

### âœ… UDP Logger
ESP32 sends all logs (`ESP_LOGx`) over UDP to the first client that sends a "ping" packet.  
No IP configuration needed â€“ works automatically in a local network.

### âœ… Git Clean Setup
Includes `.gitignore` and `sdkconfig.defaults` to keep your repository clean and portable.
